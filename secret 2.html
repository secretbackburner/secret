            “Happy Birthday to one of my dearest comrades, Seb! You have always been a great buddy ever since we first met through Discord. Both within and outside the school, you have a dual personality whose sides are both equally pleasant and fun to be with. On one hand, you are dedicated, hardworking, and locked in with your academic and professional endeavors, which made you a perfect fit as a Review HQ admin, and I’m thankful that you accepted the invitation to be the first Review HQ admins from your batch when we were in our last year of SHS, and the server flourished under the leadership of your team. On the other hand, you are passionate about expressing your love for your hobbies in autos and Gundams, with the most memorable moment for me being the time we worked on model kits together. May you always find happiness and success in your life!”

To solve for the shift if the numbers, if I were to throw 2 dice and added the numbers, what is the probability that the sum would be 8. Take the numerator and that is the shift upwards.”

        <p> I know we haven't known each other for a long time, but it's been fun working together on various stuff. When we first talked I was lowkey intimidated 
            because I kinda wanna impress people I think are way smarter than me, but eventually we became actual friends and I'm glad we did. Thanks for being that push to get me more into tech stuff, even if I'll always
            be a bio nerd. And thanks for the support when I first became a review hq tutor. And for staying up with me to work on the nscm slides despite the short notice. Yo're really frickin cool man, don't sell yourself short for anything.
            Hope you have a great day, and an even better rest of the year. Happy birthday seb :> you're a certified unc now 
            P.S you have rly good music taste </p>
